# GTR Local Lobby
This tool is designed to let you bypass the connection to the GTR online lobby in order to use the Direct IP feature. **The server list isn't implemented.** 

## How to
- Copy everything in _gameFolder to the game's folder.  
  - The TXT files make the game connect to your local computer instead of the defunct global lobby server, and the exe is the local lobby server.
- Run GTRLocalLobby.exe
- Open GTR
- Go to Simulation (no semi pro) => Multiplayer => LAN/Direct IP
- Click add server at the bottom, fill in the server IP
- When asked for credentials, use whatever it doesn't matter
- Login should be successful
- After a few seconds servers for the IP should appear in the list and accept connection as usual
